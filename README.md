# DrinkWater
This application can be used to track the daily amount of water you take. You will get a reminder through notifications also. You can instantly get an idea about your daily intake and also the weekly activity. Suggestions are welcome
This app is one of my best designed apps so far. I spent a lot of time designing and theming the interface of this app. I hope I did a justice to this app.
